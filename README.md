# Semantic Social Trend Forecasting 🚀

This project analyzes and forecasts public sentiment trends on social media using time series and deep learning models.  
We utilized datasets from Twitter and Reddit, leveraging models like PAC, ARIMA, LSTM, and Prophet to answer the question:

> **"What will people feel next?"**

### 📌 Models Implemented
- Passive-Aggressive Classifier (PAC)
- ARIMA & Prophet for time series
- LSTM for sequence prediction
- Hybrid LSTM + ARIMA for robust forecasting

### 📁 Files in this Repository
- `Copy_of_SMTA_Model.ipynb`: Complete hybrid modeling and diagnostics
- `Final_TimeSeries - Copy.ipynb`: Final version with model comparisons
- `Trend_Analysis.ipynb`: EDA, correlation, and hashtag-based analysis
- `ARIMA_PROPHET.ipynb`: Dedicated ARIMA vs Prophet implementation

### 🔍 Insights
- Political hashtags showed high emotional polarity
- Twitter trends skewed negative during real-world events
- Hybrid models outperformed individual models in RMSE and MAE
